today ,i am learning th GIT ,my head was very big.
i will give a little deliver on wenseday ,i felll a little anxiety.
but i believe i can do a better job this time compared to the last .i must trust myself .it just takes you only several minuters.
take it easy    
when you stand on the stage ,please force your attention to the content ,word,when you speak one word and mean to speak the next 
word ,i think you can look the teacher 's eye. that my be help you to calm down and then you can glare the word the next you will speak . don't nervous.
